//! Initiative-level mutations: `rename_initiative`, `delete_initiative`.
//!
//! An initiative is a scoping key, not a stored node — it lives in the
//! junction relations (`node_initiative`, `edge_initiative`) and the
//! `initiative` policy table. These verbs move or drop every trace of an
//! initiative name in one pass. Both take **explicit** names (no reliance
//! on `Store::current_initiative`), so the cloud can call them too.
