//! The OpenAPI document for the cloud's REST surface (#70).
//!
//! The cloud used to publish no schema at all: `/openapi.json` and `/docs` were
//! both 404, so the only way to learn a payload was to send something and read
//! the 422. That method can only ever reveal *required* fields — validation
//! names one missing field at a time, so an optional field is invisible to the
//! whole procedure. It produced a concrete wrong conclusion in the field: an
//! agent decided `POST /api/v1/nodes` had no `initiative` field, posted a node
//! without one, and the node was accepted and invisible to `cloud_recall`.
//!
//! The document is **derived from the handlers**, not written beside them. Each
//! route is registered through `utoipa_axum::routes!`, so the path the router
//! serves and the path the spec describes are the same attribute — they cannot
//! disagree. A hand-maintained schema would have been a second description of
//! the payload, and this issue exists because a payload was described wrongly.
//!
//! Served always and unauthenticated. There is nothing to hide in the shape of
//! the API, and the schema is only useful to a caller before it has a token
//! working.
